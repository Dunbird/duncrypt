# DunCrypt (WIP)

DunCrypt is a simple project designed to encrypt and decrypt files using an image as a cryptographic key. Encrypted files are stored in a custom `.dun` format, ensuring data integrity and security for seamless decryption.

## Features

- **Image-Based Encryption**: Use any image as a cryptographic key for encryption and decryption.
- **Custom `.dun` Format**: Encrypted files are stored in a secure, proprietary format.


## How It Works

1. **Select an Image**: Choose an image to serve as your cryptographic key.
2. **Encrypt Files**: Encrypt your files using the selected image. The output is saved in the `.dun` format.
3. **Decrypt Files**: Use the same image to decrypt the `.dun` file and retrieve the original data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DunCrypt.git
   ```
